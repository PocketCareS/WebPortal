**Call for code submission for COVID-19 track.**

PocketCare S is a comprehensive smartphone-based solution for monitoring close encounters. It is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) based solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) to see if they are close to each other (less than 2m). If so, the smartphone records the duration of such a close encounter with another beacon. 

PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual.

## The Architecture

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites for installation on local machine

Before you begin, make sure you satisfy the following requirements in order to run the server on your local system:

1. NPM (node package manager) which can be installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   
### Running the application on local system
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project on Visual Studio Code
3. Search for file constants.js
4. Update the Server API URL from [here]() and paste inplace of "YOUR_HOSTED_SERVER_API_URL"
   export const baseUrl =
  "YOUR_HOSTED_SERVER_API_URL";
5. Inside the project directory open the terminal and run the following commands in order:
     ```npm install```
    
     ```npm start```

### Steps for Openshift Deployment
1. Install the OC cli on your system using the following [link](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html)
2. Once installed, open the Openshift console
3. Copy the Login command as shown in the figure below ![](assets/2.png)
4. Copy and paste the login command in terminal at the folder where the react application source code resides.
5. Inside the terminal run the following commands in order:
     ```npm install```
    
     ```npx nodeshift --strictSSL=false --dockerImage=nodeshift/ubi8-s2i-web-app --imageTag=10.x --build.env YARN\_ENABLED=true --expose```
6. This will install the react application on Openshift and public url will be provided in terminal logs.

## How does PocketCare S Work?

### Key Highlights (Mobile Application)

1. Close encounter data will be displayed in the mobile application after a close encounter session starts. A close encounter session starts when two people are within **2 meters** for at least **5 minutes**. 
2. The **virtual bluetooth name** changes every hour to ensure **user privacy**. 
3. Data upload to the server takes place every hour.
4. Data is stored in user's phone for a maximum of 14 days.

## Built With 

In this submission, we have used IBMâ€™s Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift** to deploy our server (using **OpenJDK 8**), database (using **MongoDB**), the web portal (using **Node JS Server**) and **IBM Push Notification Service** from **IBM Cloud** in the Android application of PocketCare S as a proof of concept. In the future, we will be integrating other IBM services into the PocketCare S solution.
